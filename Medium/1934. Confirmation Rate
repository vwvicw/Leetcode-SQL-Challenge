to calculate the average rate, we can normally use AVG() if 0 or 1 binary values have been assigned, otherwise, we would need to use CASE() or "round(avg(if(c.action="confirmed",1,0)),2)"to assign values first then calculate the AVG()

in AVG(action = 'confirmation') calculation, this would return true or false which will be regarded as 0 or 1 autoamtically. Hence this could be a short cut.
